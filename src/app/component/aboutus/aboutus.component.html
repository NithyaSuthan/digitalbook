    The digital age has taken the publishing industry by storm. Digital publishing or online publishing is the process of sharing media content virtually.

        Instead of going down the conventional route of sharing information on paper, digital publishing uses technology. Digital content is accessible on computers, laptops, mobiles, tablets, and other smart devices. 
        
        When we talk about digital publishing, we only think of digital book publishing and e-newspapers. However, the digital content domain is ever widening: it not only includes books and magazines but pictures, videos, audio, games, podcasts, mobile applications, and other media forms.
        
        With digital publishing, all the print content can be digitized and published online, and the audience can access, download and share it from different devices.
